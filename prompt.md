I'm continuing work on my running log app. Here's where we left off:

**Project Status:** Completed basic Target setting.  Adding progress to targets to QuickLog and Home pages
**Current Working Directory:** running-log/frontend
**Development Environment:** Windows 10, Python 3.13, Node.js 20, SAM CLI
**Production Environment:** AWS Serverless
**Testing:** Using pytest, vitatest with TDD methodology

**Key Context:**
We have set up the landing page, home page, quick log page and target setting page.  All backend endpoints so far are in place and functioning.  Now that I have targets available, I need to include them in the progress bars for Quick Log and Home pages.  Quick Log is bringing in the targets, but is showing the progress for only the one entered run, it should show the aggregated sum for that month and year.   I would like to continue to use test driven development.
