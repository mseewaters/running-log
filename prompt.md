I'm continuing work on my running log app. Here's where we left off:

**Project Status:** Home and Quick log page basic set up.  Ready to set up user egistration and target setting, which will be enough for MVP.
**Current Working Directory:** running-log/frontend
**Development Environment:** Windows 10, Python 3.13, Node.js 20, SAM CLI
**Production Environment:** AWS Serverless
**Testing:** Using pytest, vitatest with TDD methodology

**Key Context:**
I have set up the landing page, home page and quick log.  Each is functional and calls AWS endpoints.  To get to an MVP, I need a new user registration page that include Cognito verification.  I also need to be able to set up targets.  I do not have figma designs for either of these, but the pages should be design consistent with landing, home and quick log  I would like to continue to use test driven development.
