I'm continuing work on my running log app. Here's where we left off:

**Project Status:** Backend complete, ready to work on front end
**Current Working Directory:** running-log/frontend
**Development Environment:** Windows 10, Python 3.13, Node.js 20, SAM CLI
**Production Environment:** AWS Serverless
**Testing:** Using pytest with TDD methodology

**Key Context:**
- I'd like to set up vue.js on my VS Code project and create the landing screen that includes the branding for the app and simple user log in. Reminder this is a mobile first web app. I have a figma wireframe and color palette.  I would like to continue to use test driven development.
