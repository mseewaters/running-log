I'm continuing work on my running log app. Here's where we left off:

**Project Status:** Vue.js set up, visual design developed, landing page created with user log in successful.  Ready to work on quick log page.
**Current Working Directory:** running-log/frontend
**Development Environment:** Windows 10, Python 3.13, Node.js 20, SAM CLI
**Production Environment:** AWS Serverless
**Testing:** Using pytest, vitatest with TDD methodology

**Key Context:**
Currently a user can successfullly log in from the landing page.  I'm ready to create the home page that a user will be taken to, creating only the core page design and navigation bar.  Then I want to create the quick log page in its entirety including connecting the /run endpoints.  I have figma designs for both the home and quick log pages.   I would like to continue to use test driven development.
